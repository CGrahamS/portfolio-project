          <p>I grew up an hour North and West of <em>Philadelphia</em>, Pennsylvania, just outside of Lancaster County (<em>Amish Country</em>). After finishing highschool at <strong>Aleithia Learning Community</strong>, a home-school co-op, I had no clear idead of what I wanted to do. I decided I would work for some time before I pursued <em>school</em>. I had worked for my dad at his veterinary clinic through high-school, but I wanted to do something outside so I took a lawn maintenance and landscaping job. The work was really hard, but it felt really good to work long days. I got along well with my boss and most of my co-workers. However, I was soon tired of living in the same place I had my whole life and decided to move out west. At first I lived my brother in <em>Idaho</em>, but then I transitioned to <em>Oregon City</em> and lived there with my sister and her family for some time. That was the first time I ever visited the <em>Portland</em> area. I really loved it. I <strong>knew</strong> I wanted to live here at some point.</p>
          <p>But, jobs were scarce. The only work I could find was bussing tables and the only reason I got it was because I bothered the manager <strong>every week for a month</strong> and eventually I offered to <em>work just for tips</em> so I could get my foot in the door.</p>
          <p>Once the landscaping season started back up I decided I was done bussing table and dishwashing. I flew back to <em>Pennsylvania</em> to work for my old landscaping boss again. When the season ended I moved back to <em>Idaho</em> and, after working for a coffee shop for a short time, I got a job doing land surveying.</p>

          <p>This was a very interesting job. I traveled all over the PNW and parts of Montana, Utah, Nevada and California. But about one year into the job I was <strong>hit</strong> by a car and <em>I suffered a concussion, broken nose, compound fracture to the left leg and both a compression fracture and burst fracture in my mid-back.</em> I stopped working for about a month, but once I was more mobile I started working in the office for the same surveying company. I learned how to use <em>AutoCAD</em> and put surveys together. After about 6 months of working in the office the company wanted to move its location. I knew where I wanted to move. Luckily the office manager and I agreed. So, we moved the office to <em>Portland!</em></p>
          <p>I really enjoyed a lot of the design and layout aspects of putting a land survey together, but the further up the chain of command I moved, the more I had to read real-estate documents. That I did not like. After spending a long time trying to enjoy the work, I just decided I was done. That&#39s when I really started looking into <em>Epicodus</em>. I had dabbled in code before, but never had the self-focus to really get anywhere with it. One of my good friends had made the into the tech-industry through <em>Epicodus</em>, so I decided to try it myself.</p>
