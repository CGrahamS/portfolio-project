        <p>I grew up an hour North and West of Philadelphia Pennsylvania, just outside of Lancaster County (Amish Country). After finishing highschool at Aleithia Learning Community, a home-school co-op, I decided I wanted to work for some time before I went to school. I had worked for my dad at his vet clinic through high-school, but I wanted to do something outside so I took a lawn maintenance and landscaping job. The work was really hard, but it felt really good to work long days. I got along well with my boss and most of my co-workers. However, I was soon tired of living in the same place I had my whole life and decided to move out west. At first I lived my brother in Idaho, but then I transitioned to Oregon City and lived there with my sister and her family for some time. That was the first time I ever visited Portland and I really loved it. I knew I wanted to live here at some point.</p>

        <p>But, jobs were scarce. The only work I could find was bussing tables and the only reason I got it was because I bothered the manager every week for a month and eventually offered to just work for tips so I could get my foot in the door.</p>

        <p>Once the landscaping season started back up I decided to go back to Pennsylvania and work for my old boss again. So, I went back to work for him. When the season ended I moved back to Idaho and after working for a coffee shop for a short time got a job doing land surveying. This was a very interesting job. I traveled all over the PNW and parts of Montana, Utah, Nevada and California. But about one year into the job I was hit by a car and I suffered a concussion, broken nose, compound fracture to the left leg and both a compression fracture and burst fracture in my mid-back.</p>

          <p>I stopped working for about a month, but once I was able to more mobile I started working in the office for the same surveying company. I slowly learned how to use AutoCAD and put surveys together. After about 6 months of working in the office the company wanted to move its location. I knew where I wanted to move. Luckily the office manager and I agreed. So, we moved to Portland!</p>

          <p>I really enjoyed a lot of the design and layout aspects of putting a land survey together, but the further up the chain of command I got, the more I had to read real-estate documents. That I did not like. After spending a long time trying to enjoy the work, I just decided I was done. That&#39s when I really started looking into Epicodus. I had dabbled in code before, but never had the focus to really get anywhere with it. One of my good friends had made the transition into the tech-industry using Epicodus, so I decided to try it myself.</p>

          <p>That&#39s where I am today, trying it for myself.</p>
